About global.json
Within global.json, we see projects with src and test. These are instructions 
for the new .NET execution environment dnx, which is responsible for executing 
our application. In section instructs dnx to look for projects in the listed 
folders src and test. No solution file is used for dnx, the solution file is 
for visual studio only. Instead, it relies on the global.json configuration 
file. The sdk states that the app will work for a specific version of dnx.
