@*
    The razor syntax here will be automatically added to every view that's generated.
    @addTagHelpers takes two arguments. First is the specific tag helpers you want to load.
    A * means to add all tag helpers. Second is the assembly name where the tag helpers come
    from. All built-in tag helpers come from Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.TagHelpers. If you don't 
    want tag helpers everywhere. You can put the below directive directly in a view. 
*@

@{
    @addTagHelper "*, Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.TagHelpers"
}
